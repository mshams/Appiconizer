# appiconizer
Generate all icon sizes for your apps.

Actually it’s a pain in the neck to resize icons for every app that you develop. I prefer to draw largest icon for example 512×512 or 1024×1024 and the others will be made.
The Appiconizer is an open source solution to resize icon for the selected sizes.
