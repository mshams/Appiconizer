# Appiconizer
Generate all icon sizes for your apps.

Actually it’s a pain in the neck to resize icons for every app that you develop. I prefer to draw largest icon for example 512×512 or 1024×1024 and the others will be made.
The Appiconizer is an open source solution to resize icon for the selected sizes.

## Online test
If you just want to run the app from java web start, please add "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/" as your security exceptions in java control panel applet.
Then start jnlp from here (Dropbox link): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jzsm3r96fkpxcq0/appstart.jnlp
